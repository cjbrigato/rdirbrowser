Rdirbrowser - Mini Files-Repository management

======

. Instructions :

	- git clone git://github.com/khemael/rdirbrowser.git
	- edit config/rdirbrowser.conf
	- chmod +x admin.rb uploader.rb
	- edit .htpasswd
	- edit .htaccess (for .htpasswd path)

. Requirements :

	- The "admin" (or whatever) directory should be placed under the root of your file repo (=basedir)
	- This is written for use with mod_ruby. To be used as cgi, you should add shebang to admin.rb and uploader.rb (#!/usr/bin/ruby)
	
	
. Know Issues :

	- Destroyer directory traversal vulnerability (lister is OK)
	- Can't upload files with whitespaces (will be uploaded to root)
	- Lack of mimetypes implementation

. Todo :

	--> Correct CSS Tabs (body id=tabX)
	--> Implement the "Delete/Normal" Mode in TABS
	- Sanitize "filepath" for destroyer => Directory Traversal vulnerability
	- Show file weight
	- Create Script to create dirs
	- Create readme for basic conf info
	- Sanitize whitespaces and special chars in file => Bug With uploader/destroyer
	- Implement LISTDIR mimetypes (for imgs etc)
	- Implement UPLOADER mimetypes (for auto-move of file)
	- Better Uploader result page.
	- Better Upload page
	- More config options
	- Rework CSS/layout ?
